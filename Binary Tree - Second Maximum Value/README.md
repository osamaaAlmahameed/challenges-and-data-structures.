# Binary Tree - Second Maximum Value

## Problem
Find the second maximum value in a binary tree.

The maximum value is the largest value in the tree.  
The second maximum value is the largest value among all nodes **less than the maximum value**.

### Edge Cases
- Empty tree → return null
- Single node tree → return null
- Duplicate values → return the first node found as the second maximum

## Example Tree

  5    20
 / \   / \
3   7 15 25
